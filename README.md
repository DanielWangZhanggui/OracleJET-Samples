# OracleJET-Samples
This project will hold a collection of different Oracle JET based samples and demo apps

To install, clone the project and then run "bower install" on the individual projects.
You can also open any of the individual projects directly in NetBeans with a simple project open and point to the directory.

This site and code is not sanctioned or supported by Oracle.  These are my own works and ideas.
